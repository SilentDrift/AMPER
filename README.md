# **AMPER (Adaptive Memory-Augmented Prioritized Experience Replay)**
**AMPER (Adaptive Memory-Augmented Prioritized Experience Replay)** is a reinforcement learning framework where agents dynamically adjust experience replay buffer size and prioritization, employing memory-augmented neural networks to enhance learning efficiency and adaptability in non-stationary environments requiring long-term memory.
